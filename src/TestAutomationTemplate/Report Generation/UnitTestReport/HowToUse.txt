To generate a unit test and integration test report requires us to run the the nunit test via command line. (Which is done via Jenkins)
When setting out your build steps in Jenkins create your nunit command to kick off tests as follows

nunit-console.exe <<Jenkins created temp folder>Path to the built project file>

then a second step after this to transform the TestResult.xml to HTML

specflow.exe nunitexecutionreport <<Jenkins created temp folder>Path to the built project file> /xsltFile:"ExecutionReport.xslt /out:"C:\Reports\MyResult.html"

The file name in the out parameter needs to be the path that Jenkins will archive
